experiences:
    - role: Machine Learning Intern
      time: Summer, 2018
      company: Hearst, New York
      details: |
        - Incorporated content based image retrieval into Hearst's digital asset management 
        system consisting of over 13 million images. We utilized a product quantizer based 
        nearest neighbor search on image features extracted from deep models pre-trained on 
        ImageNet.
        - Developed an efficient image visualization and tagging tool that utilizes 
        t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).

      - title: Estimating Sample Complexity in Deep Neural Networks
        details: |
          - The most common and effective strategy in deep learning to improve performance and 
            reduce generalization error is to collect more training data \textit{but} the 
            fundamental question: "how much data do we need to achieve certain desirable 
            performance?" still remains open. We aim to present a practical and predictive 
            probabilistic method to model the relationship between training data sizes and 
            misclassification rate.

      - title: VisualBackProp for learning using privileged information with CNNs
        link: https://bit.ly/2YV5uP4
        details: |
          - Proposed a novel training paradigm for CNNs based on learning using privileged 
            information (LUPI) previously proposed for SVMs. Priviledge information 
            (segmentation mask) was incorporated into training by additional loss functions 
            to focus model's attention on the desired region of the input image. Proposed 
            method was verified through experiments on ImageNet and PASCAL VOC data sets and 
            performance improvements of 2.4% and 2.7% over standard single-supervision 
            model were obtained.

      - title: Towards Automated Melanoma Detection with Deep Learning:Data Purification and Augmentation
        link: https://bit.ly/2GV8PYn
        details: |
          - Proposed a data preparation strategy to tackle detrimental effects of biased data-sets 
            on deep learning models. We utilized partial convolutions for removal of occlusions 
            and synthetic data generation through coupled GAN to balance disease classes. We demonstrate 
            its effectiveness on ISIC 2017 and 2018 grand challenge.

      - title: High Frequency Ultrasound Image Segmentation and Analysis
        link: https://github.com/devansh20la/MedViewer
        details: |
          - Trained an Active Shape Model to segment brain ventricles of a mouse embryo from 
            its high frequency 3D Ultrasound image. The shape of the brain ventricle was described 
            using a shape context descriptor while principle component analysis was used to 
            generate the model.
